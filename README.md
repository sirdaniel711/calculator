## To-Do List:
- Maybe add a decimal and negative/positive toggle button
- Add the ability for repeated "=" clicks to reapply the current operation
- Add support for scientific/exponential notation, along with an exponential button
- Needs more testing with negative numbers
- And more

## Updates:
- Version 1.5
    * Improved the layout of the code to make it a little more readable and efficient
    * Added extra keyboard support for enter and lower case c
    * Fixed a few bugs, including:
        - Dividing by 0 would cause the result to be infinity
        - The overflow message would not display for full numbers that are too large to fit on the display
        - Hitting backspace or the back button on a decimal number would make it 0 isntead of removing the last digit
- Version 1.4
    * Added keyboard support as an input option
- Version 1.3
    * Added support for decimal numbers (still need to add a decimal button)
    * Added a limit to the number of digits to fit in the display (does not currently support scientific/exponential notation)
- Version 1.1
    * Added a mini-display for the current operator
- Version 1.0
    * Initial version
